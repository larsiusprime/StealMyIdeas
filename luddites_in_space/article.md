# Luddites in Space

## Overarching theme

I always thought it was cool that in the 2000's Battlestar Galactica series the 
human military fleet was reduced to a single Battlestar-class precisely because
the Galactica was an old rustbucket. You see, once upon a time there was this
big war with the robotic Cylons, who were adept at hacking computer networks.
The humans responded with a borderline paranoid design ethos that relied on 
land-line phones and simple radios for onboard ship communication, using 
computers only when necessary, and then only with strict 
[airgapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_%28networking%29). The humans
won the war, and as the years wore on these measures that had once protected 
them started to grate; widespread networking brought many efficiencies, and the
Cylon menace was no more. Pretty soon every single ship in the human fleet was
a shiny & efficient fully-networked computerized machine. Then, out of nowhere
the Cylons reappear, hack the entire fleet in one fell swoop, and nearly 
exterminate all of humanity. All that's left is that trusty old rust-bucket, the 
Galactica.

There's a cool game idea in here somewhere, and I like the subversive message
that the ever-forwards march of technology has a lot more downsides than we're
ready to admit.

The term "Luddite" is a general epithet deployed against anyone who has a 
negative view of technology. Kirkpatrick Sale's excellent book [Rebels Against 
The Future](https://www.amazon.com/Rebels-Against-Future-Industrial-Revolution/dp/0201407183) 
is an amazing corrective to this ahistorical treatment of the subject.

The Amish are another case of people misunderstanding those with a skeptical 
view of modern technology. For one, [Amish actually do use technology](https://amishamerica.com/do-amish-use-technology/),
they just have a very strict philosophical basis for deciding which technologies
they choose to use -- the chief guiding light being avoiding ones likely to 
disrupt their way of life and damage their communities. Not to mention he Amish 
are actually [avid inventors!](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2366217/Gas-powered-lamps-steam-powered-ice-cream-makers--The-ingenious-solutions-Amish-use-bring-modern-technology-lives.html)

This is a large overarching idea rather than a specific game mechanic, but 
here's a concrete ideas that I might expand on later:

## Security War

This one's directly inspired by Battlestar Galactica. Take a typical game where 
you fight eachother with fleets of spaceships. One technology you might research
is remote-controlled drone ships. These are great because they don't require
expensive and bulky life support modules, so you can cram them full of more 
weapons. However, since there's no meatspace beings aboard to pull the manual
overrides, they're particularly vulnerable to being hacked and turned against 
you by a sufficiently network-savvy enemy. So you could do things Galactica 
style and build analog-powered rustbuckets, at the cost of overall efficiency
and power.

And you don't necessarily need to put this in space, either. This idea is 
basically [Internet of S#*!](https://twitter.com/internetofshit): the game.

## Okay, so what?

The whole point of this idea is to model the negative externalities of modern 
technology, and playing with the tradeoff between increased efficiency and power 
(modern and shiny) vs. reliability, redundancy and defense against cascading 
failure (old and rusty).
